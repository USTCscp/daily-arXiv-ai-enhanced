The Evolution of Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra in Galaxies", "comment": "18 pages, 17 figures. Submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are key tracers of non-thermal processes in galaxies, yet their spectra are often modelled under the untested assumption of steady state between injection and cooling. In this work, we present a time-dependent modelling of CR electron spectra in a galactic context using the CREST code, applied to magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-mass galaxy performed with AREPO. CR electrons are injected at supernova sites and evolved with adiabatic changes and cooling processes on Lagrangian tracer particles, including losses from synchrotron, inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung, and Coulomb interactions. We compare these fully time-dependent spectra to local and global steady-state models computed with CRAYON+, as well as to one-zone analytic steady-state solutions. We find that the global CR electron spectrum in the simulated galactic disk closely resembles a steady-state solution up to energies of 500 GeV, with deviations only at higher energies where cooling times become shorter than injection timescales. High-energy electrons are dominated by recently injected populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, however, producing a steeper spectrum and lower normalisation than a steady-state model predicts. Spatially, the electrons modelled on-the-fly with CREST are more confined to the star-forming disk, in contrast to the more extended distributions from steady-state post-processing models. Our results demonstrate that while steady-state assumptions capture the bulk CR electron population in star-forming disks, a time-dependent treatment is essential to describe the high-energy and outflowing components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7535\u5b50\u8c31\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2dCR\u7535\u5b50\u5728500GeV\u4ee5\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u504f\u79bb\u7a33\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u5c04\u7ebf\u7535\u5b50\u8c31\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a33\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9CR\u7535\u5b50\u8c31\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CREST\u4ee3\u7801\u5728AREPO\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5b64\u7acb\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u8d28\u91cf\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u4f4d\u70b9\u6ce8\u5165CR\u7535\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u793a\u8e2a\u7c92\u5b50\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7edd\u70ed\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u51b7\u5374\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40CR\u7535\u5b50\u8c31\u5728500GeV\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e0e\u7a33\u6001\u89e3\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u5904\u504f\u79bb\u7a33\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7535\u5b50\u7531\u8fd1\u671f\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u672a\u8fbe\u5e73\u8861\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a33\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u76d8\u4e2d\u5927\u90e8\u5206CR\u7535\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ad8\u80fd\u548c\u6d41\u51fa\u7ec4\u5206\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

We also detect a narrow, $\\sim$57 kpc X-ray surface brightness deficit-a potential plasma depletion layer-likely shaped by residual sloshing motions that amplified magnetic fields and/or displaced gas within the cluster core. Although the AGN injects $\\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of energy, comparable to the cluster's cooling luminosity, radiative cooling persists at $\\sim$15 M$_{\\odot} $yr$^{-1}$, replenishing the billion solar mass cold gas reservoir at the heart of the brightest cluster galaxy. Sustaining this level of activity requires a continuous fuel supply, yet the estimated Bondi accretion power ($\\sim 2 \\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) falls an order of magnitude short of the observed cavity power, suggesting that \"hot\" gas fueling is insufficient.

However, most studies employ fitting algorithms that are prone to be trapped in local minima, or involve subjective choices. Furthermore, when applied on samples beyond the nearby Universe, results on the fraction of classical bulges in disc galaxies do not agree with studies on nearby galaxies. The latter studies point to a small fraction of classical bulges, possibly challenging our merger-driven picture of galaxy formation. Therefore, understanding the discrepancy between observations in and beyond the nearby Universe is of paramount importance. In this paper, I use a sample of 16 nearby galaxies drawn from the TIMER project, which previously have been shown to not host classical bulges, and perform decompositions applying different methodologies and employing the original images as well as artificially redshifted images. I show that the Differential Evolution algorithm is able to provide accurate measurements of structural properties with little subjective intervention, correctly indicating the presence of nuclear discs (not classical bulges). However, I also show that when the physical spatial resolution is not adequate, a systematic overestimation of the photometric bulge S\u00e9rsic index leads to the false conclusion of the presence of classical bulges. I discuss how this may be the root cause of the discrepancy mentioned above, and point out how this issue may be a problem even with data from facilities such as Euclid, HST and JWST.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea2\u79fb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6838\u7403S\u00e9rsic\u6307\u6570\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5f97\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u7403\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u90bb\u8fd1\u5b87\u5b99\u548c\u66f4\u8fdc\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u76d8\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u7403\u6bd4\u4f8b\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u6311\u6218\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u9a71\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528TIMER\u9879\u76ee\u768416\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea2\u79fb\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6838\u76d8\uff08\u800c\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u7403\uff09\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u4f46\u5f53\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u6838\u7403\u7684S\u00e9rsic\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u5f97\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u7403\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5373\u4f7f\u5728Euclid\u3001HST\u548cJWST\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Tables A1 and A2 contain bias estimates for observations of infrared-luminous galaxies over 0<z<5 with JWST and other observatories", "summary": "Infrared-luminous galaxies are important sites of stellar and black hole mass assembly at most redshifts. Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below $20\\%$. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by $\\gtrsim20\\%$. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies.

Formation of the initial ions, H$^+$ and H$_2^+$, is dominated by cosmic-ray ionization of H and H$_2$, making the cosmic-ray ionization rate (denoted $\u03b6({\\rm X})$ for species X) an important parameter for chemical modeling. We have made observations targeting absorption lines of H$_3^+$, one of the most reliable tracers of $\u03b6({\\rm H_2})$, toward diffuse molecular cloud sight lines where the H$_2$ column density has been directly measured in the ultraviolet, detecting H$_3^+$ in 12 out of 27 sight lines. The 3D-PDR modeling method introduced by Obolentseva et al. (2024) was used to infer cosmic-ray ionization rates in the clouds along these sight lines, and our combined sample has a mean ionization rate of $5.3\\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ with standard deviation $2.5\\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. By associating H$_3^+$ absorption with gas density peaks derived from the differential extinction maps of Edenhofer et al. (2024) we have constructed a sparsely sampled 3D map of the cosmic-ray ionization rate in targeted regions within about 1~kpc of the Sun. Specific regions show reasonably uniform ionization rates over length scales of tens of parsecs, with the average ionization rate in each region being different. Large differences (factor of 5) in $\u03b6({\\rm H_2})$ are found over length scales of about 100 pc. This supports a picture where the cosmic-ray ionization rate varies smoothly over small size scales, but is not uniform everywhere in the Galactic disk, likely being controlled by proximity to particle acceleration sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4bH$_3^+$\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f25\u6f2b\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u4e2d\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u79bb\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u79bb\u7387\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u5185\u5e76\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u6e90\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u79bb\u662f\u5f25\u6f2b\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u79bb\u7387\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u9645\u5316\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002H$_3^+$\u662f\u6d4b\u91cf\u03b6(H$_2$)\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u89c2\u6d4b27\u6761\u89c6\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u7684H$_3^+$\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D-PDR\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u65ad\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u79bb\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u5206\u6d88\u5149\u56fe\u5c06H$_3^+$\u5438\u6536\u4e0e\u6c14\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5cf0\u503c\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u572827\u6761\u89c6\u7ebf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u523012\u6761H$_3^+$\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7535\u79bb\u7387\u4e3a5.3\u00d710$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5dee2.5\u00d710$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u9644\u8fd1\u7ea61kpc\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u76843D\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u79bb\u7387\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b87\u5b99\u7ebf\u7535\u79bb\u7387\u5728\u6570\u5341\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ea6100pc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u57285\u500d\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7535\u79bb\u7387\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u76d8\u5185\u5e76\u975e\u5904\u5904\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u7c92\u5b50\u52a0\u901f\u6e90\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \\lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \\gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas.

We suggest that this patchy and spatially extended UV emission is likely due to ongoing star formation (SF) in the galaxy. The estimated SF rate (SFR) averaged over 100 Myr for the UV knot ($0.23\\pm0.10$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is significantly higher compared to a typical elliptical galaxy. As the galaxy does not show the signatures of recent major mergers, the possible mechanisms for the triggered SF include AGN feedback or minor mergers. Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations reveal dust filaments that extend through a UV knot. The origin of dusty filaments, though not clear, could be associated with gas clouds as a result of a minor merger, cooled gas falling into the central BCG and/or condensing of the gas uplifted by AGN jet. No significant clumpy UV emission is observed in other regions along the dust filament.

With the available high-resolution UV observations from AstroSat-UVIT, complemented by GALEX, we studied the SF properties in the outskirts ($>0.5R_{25}$) of six AGN-host galaxies and compared them with four non-AGN galaxies of similar morphology. We observed a higher SF rate density ($\u03a3_{\\text{SFR}}$) for the UV knots in AGN-host galaxies, and it falls off less rapidly compared to non-AGN galaxies, suggesting positive AGN feedback in the outskirts of AGN-host galaxies. Additionally, FUV attenuation (A$_{\\text{FUV}}$) is also enhanced in the outer regions and falls less rapidly in AGN-host compared to non-AGN, indicating that the feedback could be coupled with dust.

In this review, we summarise the main observational and theoretical results achieved in the last decades in the study of chemistry evolution in high-mass star-forming regions, and in the identification of chemical evolutionary indicators. Emphasis is especially given to observational studies, for which most of the work has been carried out so far.

Accepted for publication in ApJS", "summary": "We have carried out unprecedentedly deep, nearly confusion-limited JCMT-SCUBA2 mapping observations on the nearest spiral galaxy, M31 (Andromeda). The 850 $\u03bc$m image with a $\\sim$50 pc resolution yields a comprehensive catalog of 383 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) that are associated with the spiral arms. In addition, it unveiled a population of 189 compact inter-arm GMCs in M31, which are mostly unresolved or marginally resolved. The masses of all these GMCs are in the range of 2$\\times$10$^4$ -- 6$\\times$10$^6$ $M_{\\odot}$; the sizes are in the range of 30--130 pc. They follow a mass-size correlation, $M$ $\\propto$ $R_{c}$$^{2.5}$. The inter-arm GMCs are systematically less massive, more diffuse, colder, and have lower star-forming efficiency (SFE) than on-arm GMCs. Moreover, within individual spatially resolved on-arm and off-arm M31 GMCs, the SFE is considerably lower than the SFE in molecular clouds in main sequence and green valley galaxies. Follow-up investigations on M31 GMCs may provide clues for how star formation may be quenched in galactic environments.

The Misty Moons is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0257.1-2325 at $z=0.505$, and has five multiple images suggested by two independent lensing models. Two of the five images, ID1 and ID2 ($\u03bc\\sim 20-30$), are very bright (F200W$\\sim26$ AB mag) and exhibit blue SEDs with prominent Ly$\u03b1$ breaks. In the source plane, the Misty Moons is a sub-$L^*$ galaxy ($M_{\\rm UV}\\sim-18.0$ mag) resolved into multiple stellar clumps, each of which has effective radius of $r_\\mathrm{eff}\\sim 10-70$ pc and stellar mass of $\\sim10^7\\ M_\\odot$. These clumps dominate the stellar mass budget of the Misty Moons ($\\gtrsim80\\%$), similar to other high-$z$ clumps, which suggests a highly clustered mode of star formation in the early Universe, unlike seen in local dwarf galaxies. We convolve the source-plane image with the JWST/NIRCam point-spread function to produce a mock NIRCam image of the Misty Moons without lensing magnification, and find that the intrinsic galaxy has a radial surface-brightness profile comparable to those of $z\\gtrsim10$ faint galaxies, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, indicating that the Misty Moons represents a typical $z\\gtrsim10$ faint galaxy.

We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback.

We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$\u03b2$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$\u03b2$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\\log_{10} M_\\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u5149\u5b66\u7a84\u7ebf\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\u7684\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u6bd4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u661f\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSDSS-IV DR17\u4e2dMaNGA\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u573a\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Ji & Yan (2020)\u7684\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8bca\u65ad\u6280\u672f\u8bc6\u522bAGN\u661f\u7cfb\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u5176H\u03b2\u548c[O III]\u7ebf\u5149\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3aAGN\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0AGN\u53d1\u751f\u7387F_AGN\u5728\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u968f\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u5b9a\u6216\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5728\u9759\u6b62\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u968f\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u5728\u6052\u661f\u8d28\u91cflog10 M* > 10.25\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u968f\u7279\u5b9a\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "AGN\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u6027\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
